Graph Theory

1. vertex - v
2. edge  - e - line between two vertices
3. represenation -> e1 = {v1, v2}, where e1 is thr edge between two vertices v1 and v2.
4. |V| - order of graph, |E| - size of the graph
5. self loop - edge starting on a vertex and ending on the same vertex
6. multi-edges - more than one paralles edges between two vertices
7. pseudo graph - graph containing self loop and multiedges
8. multi graph -  graph containing multiedges and no self loop
9. simple graph - graph containing no self loop and no multiedges
10. adjacent vertices - neighbours - vertices are said to be adjacent when they have common edge between.
11. adjacent edges - edge connecting two vertices
12. directed graph - graph containing directed edges
13. degree of vertex - no of outgoing edges adjacent vertices

Applications: 
1. Locations - e.g. Google Maps, Uber, Ola etc
2. Computations - e.g. facebook, youtube, google search engine, clustor computaions (hadoop, spark)
3. Bio -molecular srtucture etc

Types of Graph:
1. Regular graph - A simple graph where every vertex have same degree. Formula to calculate no of edges -> (n*d)/2
2. Complete graph - A simple graph where every vertes is adjacent to every other vertex.
   Formula to calculate no of edges -> nC2 = (n*(n-1))/2, where n is no of vertex and n-1 is degree of a vertex.
